      </p>

<ul>
          <li>
            <a href="/concepts/220">Implement a design</a>
          </li>
      </ul>
 <p>In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page.
You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously. </p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.</p>

<p>Here the final result:</p>
